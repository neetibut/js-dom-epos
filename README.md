# ShopX - E-Commerce Web App

## 📌 Overview

ShopX is a modern e-commerce web application designed to provide shopkeepers with a simple, efficient way to browse products, add them to a cart, and complete the checkout process. Built with **Vanilla JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite**, ShopX focuses on teaching beginners about **JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), DOM manipulation, and dynamic user interface creation**.

This educational project **does not yet include a backend server or database connection**. Instead, it uses `localStorage` for temporary data persistence, simulating a simple e-commerce workflow.
